1. Prepare Your Repository Files
   
Since GitHub is a code-hosting platform, uploading just the .pbix file isn't enough for a great portfolio. Include these files:
The .pbix file: Your main Power BI file.
Data Source (CSV/Excel): If the data is public, include the raw IPL datasets so others can see your data cleaning process.
A "Screenshots" folder: High-quality images of your dashboard pages (e.g., Team Performance, Player Stats, Toss Analysis).
A PDF Export: A static version of the report for quick viewing.

2. Create a Compelling README.md
   
 is the most important part. Since you are looking for Data Analyst roles, your README should tell a story. Use this structure:
Project Title: IPL Analysis Dashboard (2008–2024)
Introduction: A 2-line summary of why you built this (e.g., analyzing 16+ years of IPL history to find winning trends).
Key Insights: Bullet points of what the dashboard reveals (e.g., "The impact of winning the toss on match outcomes" or "Orange Cap trends over the decades").
Tech Stack: * Tool: Power BI Desktop
Data Cleaning: Power Query (M Language)
Calculations: DAX (Measures for strike rates, economy, etc.)
Dashboard Preview: Embed one of your screenshots here so it's the first thing people see.
How to Use: Instructions for others to download the .pbix and open it in Power BI Desktop.

3. Professional Steps to Upload
   
Initialize: Create a new repository on your GitHub (username: Ravin174) named IPL-Data-Analysis.
Upload: Use the "Upload files" button or Git commands to add your files.
Link (Optional but Recommended): If you have a Power BI Service account, use "Publish to Web" to get a public link and paste that link at the top of your GitHub repository description. This allows recruiters to interact with your dashboard live.

4. Resume Integration
   
Once uploaded, you can add this to your resume under "Projects":
